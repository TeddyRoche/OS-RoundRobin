    Processes:
        In the context of the round-robin scheduling algorithm, "processes" refer to the tasks or jobs that need to be executed by the system.
        Each process typically has attributes such as its name, arrival time (when it enters the system), burst time (how long it needs to execute), 
        and remaining time (how much time is left to complete it).
        In the provided code, processes is a list or array containing all the processes that need to be scheduled for execution.

    Time Quantum:
        The time quantum is a parameter used in the round-robin scheduling algorithm.
        It represents the maximum amount of time each process is allowed to execute in one time slice or quantum.
        When a process is scheduled for execution, it runs for the duration of the time quantum.
        If the process completes within the time quantum, it is removed from the CPU, allowing the next process in the queue to execute.
        If the process still has remaining execution time after the time quantum elapses, it is put back into the queue to be executed later.
        In the provided code, timeQuantum is a variable representing the time quantum value used in the scheduling algorithm.

    Queue:
        A queue is a data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, meaning the first element added to the queue is the 
        first one to be removed.
        In the context of the round-robin scheduling algorithm, a queue is used to hold processes that are ready to execute but have not yet been assigned CPU time.
        As processes arrive or complete their execution, they are enqueued or dequeued from this queue accordingly.
        In the provided code, queue refers to a queue data structure (either custom or from the standard library) used to hold processes that are ready to execute.

    Current Time:
        current_time is a variable used to keep track of the passage of time during the scheduling process. 
        It represents the current time in the system clock or simulation clock.
        As the round-robin scheduling algorithm progresses, current_time is incremented whenever a process completes its execution 
        or when there are no processes ready to execute at the current time slice.
        In the provided code, current_time is a variable used to track the progress of time during the scheduling algorithm execution.
