    Initialization:
        MLFQ initializes several queues, each with its own priority level. Typically, there's a higher priority queue with a shorter time quantum and lower priority queues with longer time quanta.

    Process Arrival:
        When a new process arrives in the system, it's initially placed in the highest priority queue.

    Scheduling Decision:
        The scheduler selects the process from the highest priority non-empty queue for execution.
        If multiple queues contain processes, the scheduler typically selects the one with the highest priority.
        The scheduling decision may depend on various factors such as process priority, time spent in the queue, etc.

    Time Quantum and Preemption:
        Each queue is associated with a specific time quantum, determining how long a process can execute before being preempted.
        If a process consumes its entire time quantum without completing, it's preempted and moved to the next lower priority queue.
        Preemption involves saving the process state and context switching to another process.

    Priority Adjustment:
        MLFQ adjusts the priority of processes dynamically based on their behavior.
        Processes that frequently use the CPU may be demoted to lower priority queues to provide fair CPU access to other processes.
        Conversely, processes that perform I/O operations or exhibit other behaviors may be promoted to higher priority queues.

    Feedback Mechanism:
        MLFQ employs a feedback mechanism to adapt to the behavior of processes over time.
        For example, if a process frequently exhausts its time quantum without completing, it may be demoted to a lower priority queue.
        On the other hand, if a process frequently relinquishes the CPU voluntarily, it may be promoted to a higher priority queue.

    Starvation Prevention:
        MLFQ often incorporates mechanisms to prevent starvation, ensuring that processes in lower priority queues eventually receive CPU time.
        This may involve techniques such as priority aging, where the priority of a process increases the longer it waits in a lower priority queue.

    Dynamic Adaptation:
        MLFQ continuously adapts its scheduling parameters based on system load and process behavior to optimize performance under varying conditions.
